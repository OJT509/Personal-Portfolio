                                Currently studying for my degree in Software Engineering at the University of

                                    in Python. It allows a user to enter, for example a Twitter handle username and

                                    the application will produce a dataset that you can tailor to what you want to
                                    see.
                                    E.g. most liked tweet or retweet. It also has the functionality to plot the

                                    data on a graph via the MatPlot library for Python, allowing easier

                                    This tool utilises many

                                            In my spare time I have done a lot of website development and tried to learn
                                            as many areas as I possibly can. At the moment, HTML, CSS and
                                            JavaScript and my strongest areas however, I have had some exposure to some
                                            of the following areas and technologies both in University, my spare time

                                            as part of my University assignment whereby it would generate you a string

                                                    as it could easily range what I was doing on
                                                    a day to day basis. An example of some roles were; attending to the
                                                    arcade area, making sure everything was clean, working and open for
                                                    business whilst also
                                                    attending to any customer needs. Once I turned 18 I was then given
                                                    the
                                                    opportunity to work behind the bar serving food and drinks to
                                                    customers,
                                                    which in turn
                                                    drove me to take on more bar work in my next job.
