                                <p>
                                    I am a soon to be graduate after completing four years of study for the degree of Software Engineering at the University of Huddersfield.
                                    Recently, I was employed at the university and completed a year-long placement as a cybersecurity software engineer, under the supervision of
                                    <a href="https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-parkinson"><span class="link">Dr. Simon Parkinson</span></a> in the
                                    <a href="https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/ccs/"><span class="link">Centre for Cyber Security</span></a>.
                                    Here I could expand my programming skills exponentially and further my people skills. Whether this was working on
                                    website design, a C# application or assisting PhD students with research
                                    papers, it was a great experience.
                                    I have a strong interest and passion for website development with keen attention to detail. I also enjoy the topic of Distributed Ledger Technology and the applications it has.

                                    icon on my profile to the left. If you would like more details on my placement or any
                                    other work experience, it can be found by pressing the LinkedIn icon or scrolling further down.

                                            was based on distributed ledger technology. The idea behind it is was to investigate current voting fraud techniques
                                            and how they can be alleviated by proposing a de-centralised, blockchain based voting solution. This was built to run on the Ethereum network in conjunction with Metamask, a Google chrome extension and Ganache which
                                            allowed the execution of a locally running blockchain. I am also in the process of building on my old University
                                            web-development project which is a CRUD application for cars, implementing features such as advanced validation techniques and OAuth authentication.

                                            one of my chosen final year modules of study.
                                            In my spare time I have done a lot of website development and tried to learn
                                            as many areas as I possibly can. At the moment, HTML, CSS and
                                            JavaScript and my strongest areas, however I have had some exposure to some
                                            of the following areas and technologies both in University, my spare time
                                            and online courses I have taken such as Udemy bootcamps. I aim to improve them more as soon as

                                            My first programming language! When I first came to University this was the
                                            language that was taught.
                                            Although I use it a lot less now, I have still had a fair amount of exposure
                                            working with it.<br><br>
                                            Despite it not been the greatest piece of software ever, I managed to
                                            create a typing game
                                            as part of my University assignment whereby it would generate you a random string
                                            and then match what you had
                                            inputted on your keyboard. It would then give / deduct points based on your answer and
                                            speed.
